["U.S. Senators on Tuesday sharply criticized a new Securities and Exchange Commission rule forcing companies to disclose their use of derivatives.\nBoth the SEC and the Financial Accounting Standards Board have issued proposals to make companies disclose more about derivatives use following some high-profile losses on the complex instruments in 1994.  \nDerivatives, financial instruments such as options and futures whose value is based on an underlying stock or commodity price, were involved in the bankruptcy of Orange County, Calif., and losses exceeding $100 million at Procter &amp; Gamble Co.\nThe SEC adopted its rules last month, while the FASB is still working on its proposal.\nOn Capitol Hill on Tuesday, senators took aim at both approaches, charging that the added expenses and complications would discourage companies from properly using derivatives to reduce risk.  \n\"One of my chief concerns when I came to the Senate in 1993 was whether we had too many unnecessary rules and regulations,\" North Carolina Republican Sen. Lauch Faircloth said at a hearing of the Senate Banking Committee's securities subcommittee. \"I am concerned this may be the case with the SEC's new rule.\"\n\"At this juncture, I don't agree with the direction we're heading in,\" Faircloth added.\nFASB is a private organization that makes accounting standards, but the SEC must approve its rules to make them binding on public companies.  \nSenators questioned whether the the recent rule proposals adequately addressed the 1994 problems. While the rules focus on derivatives, the 1994 situations were caused not by the instruments but by the people in charge of those investments, Sen. Christopher Dodd said.\n\"I think what most of us concluded was the problem there was not the instrument but the human element,\" the Connecticut Democrat said.\nAnd neither rule would affect Orange County, a municipal government not bound by most FASB or SEC rules, the legislators observed.  \n\"Interestingly enough, the regulation, as almost always happens, doesn't even apply to Orange County -- it applies to corporate America,\" said Sen. Phil Gramm, who presided over the hearing.\nGramm opened the hearing expressing his doubts about the rules. After hearing from industry representatives and SEC commissioner Steven Wallman, the Texas Republican said he was still worried.\n\"I'm not converted,\" Gramm said. \"In fact, every concern I had at the beginning, I have even more now.\"  \nGramm was a prominent opponent of the accounting board in an earlier dispute over proposed rules on executive stock options.\nIn an unprecedented vote, the Senate passed a non-binding resolution in 1994 urging FASB to abandon the plan that would have required companies to reduce earnings to account for the value of stock options granted to executives. A few months after the vote, the board quashed the proposal.\nThat was the only previous time he took on the FASB, Gramm said after Tuesday's hearing. \"I just never could figure out where they were coming from,\" he said.  \nThe Republican Congress has since passed a law allowing legislators to overturn agency rules directly, Gramm said. \"I think we have the power in Congress to override the regulation if we decided to,\" he said, but added \"I haven't made that decision.\"\nCommissioner Wallman defended the new rules and said the SEC had made several changes from an earlier proposal to address industry complaints.\nHe denied the rules would discourage companies from properly using derivatives to manage and reduce business risk.\n\"Quite the opposite, the better investors understand the potential impact of market-sensitive instruments on their investments, the more likely it is that management will be able to engage in appropriate risk management,\" Wallman said.\n--Aaron Pressman ((202-898-8312))\n", "Two members of Congress criticised the Federal Reserve Thursday for what they called its \"woefully inadequate\" record of hiring and promoting women and minorities.\nRepresentative Henry Gonzalez and Representative Jesse Jackson Jr., in a letter to Fed chairman Alan Greenspan, said several discrimination lawsuits against the bank \"show a clear need for reform.\"\nThe letter paired persistent Fed critic Gonzalez, a Democrat from Texas serving his 19th term in Congress, with second-term Illinois Democrat Jackson, son of the well-known civil rights leader.\nA Fed spokesman declined comment.\nOne of the lawsuits, filed against the central bank in January by four black secretaries, may be expanded as 15 other current and former employees have asked to join the litigation, the two Democratic lawmakers said.\n\"As one of the nation's primary banking regulators, the Federal Reserve should serve as a model for the banking system it regulates,\" the two wrote to Greenspan.\n\"Despite being at the forefront in carrying out the nation's laws, we are concerned that the Federal Reserve's record of diversity in hiring and promotion is woefully inadequate.\"\nThe four black secretaries filed suit Jan. 21 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia on behalf of themselves and \"all others similarly situated.\"\nA black Fed researcher won a similiar suit against the bank in 1994, the Congressmen noted.\nGonzalez and Jackson asked Greenspan to assess the validity of the complaints and report if any action has been taken to address the alleged problems.\nThey did commend the central bank for increasing the number of women and minorities among the most highly paid Fed employees over the past three years.\nIn 1993, only one woman and one non-white were among the 35 top paid staff earning more than $125,000. Now, with 72 people making that much, 11 are women and five are minorities.\nThe hiring of additional women \"is an important step in ending what appeared to be gender bias in the selection of top staff, but it is still below comparable government standards which are also too low,\" Gonzalez and Jackson said. Minority representation \"remains poor.\"\n", "Commuters stuck in traffic on the Leesburg Pike in Northern Virginia are just a few hundred yards away from an even bigger jam, one that stretches around the world.\nThis is a traffic jam of bits and bytes, digital data travelling through one of the main arteries of the global Internet.\nWith thousands of new users signing on every day, the Internet's data routes are brimming with traffic and some predict the imminent demise of the net due to overcrowding.\n\"Demand for the Internet is outstripping supply,\" said Mark Luker, programme director of the National Science Foundation's network infrastructure project.\nBut work is under way to provide more capacity through technical solutions and ways are being explored to ration the Internet by price, through fees based on the speed and quantity of data.\nThe facility in Northern Virginia is a computer interchange, called Mae East, where 46 major and minor Internet service providers come together to exchange data travelling across the Internet.\nBUSIEST PUBLIC EXCHANGE POINT ON THE INTERNET, FIRM SAYS\nMFS Communications Inc, which runs Mae East and its California counterpart Mae West, describes it as \"the busiest public exchange point on the Internet.\" Peak loads run as high as 53 million bytes per second.\nUntil April 1995, the National Science Foundation (NSF) managed and financed the common highway underpinning most of the Internet, called a network backbone.\nBefore the network was phased out in favour of privately managed networks, traffic increased steadily from 1.3 trillion bytes a month in March 1991 to a high of 17.8 trillion bytes in late 1994, the equivalent of transfering the entire contents of the Library of Congress every four months.\nThe private system sends data across a host of different company networks and crowded interchange points. As the load continues to increase, MFS and the Internet providers can add more fibre optic lines and switching equipment, but that is expensive and still may fail to keep up with rising usage.\nSome providers are setting up smaller, one-to-one interchanges to relieve the burden on Mae East. MCI Communications, which has seen a 5,000 percent increase in Internet traffic since the beginning of 1995, set up 22 circuits for one-to-one exchanges.\nFor now, the best solution is to keep adding hardware, said Luker. \"But in the long run, you can solve problems by adding knowledge to the system instead of brute force,\" he said.\nThe NSF recently announced 13 grants for the development of high speed networking technologies and software programmes.\nIDEAS TO REDUCE CONGESTION\nOne project hopes to reduce congestion by developing a system, called caching, to hold copies of popular sites at duplicate locations around the world.\nIf an Internet user in Japan tries to download a web page in New York, the data must travel all the way around the world, even if another user in Japan has just downloaded the same page. With a cache, the second user could grab the page from a closer computer that the data had already gone through.\n\"A cache automatically duplicates the pages that are used most often,\" Luker explained. The NSF had sponsored a study at the National Laboratory for Advanced Networking Research of a cache that \"is showing great improvements in traffic.\"\nA procedure called multicasting could also reduce repetitive data transfers, said Robert Hagens, MCI's director of Internet engineering. Multicasting sends a stream of data such as sound or video across the net that can be accessed by many users.\n\"If you look at the radio stations beginning to appear on the Internet, they commonly require each listener to open a connection to the station so you've got a lot of duplication,\" Hagens said. \"With multicast, you put that data into a stream of packets that only get duplicated when they have to.\"\nNew ways of charging for Internet usage may alter the traffic patterns, as well. At the moment, most users pay a flat rate for Internet service regardless of how much capacity they use. Sending e-mail is considerably less taxing than sending live videos, but users pay the same for both.\n\"The Internet is a mature technology but an immature economy,\" said Hal Varian, dean of the University of California's School of Information Management and Systems. The current pricing model does not provide incentives to Internet providers to offer high quality service, he said.\nPeople who need high priority channels for sending live video might have to pay more, Varian said, but basic tasks like sending e-mail will remain essentially free.\nVarian also predicted Internet service providers will begin paying each other based on the amount of traffic they exchange, much as phone carriers make settlement payments to foreign telecommunications companies for completing international calls.\nMuch of the slowdown experienced by individuals trying to surf the World Wide Web is caused by limits at each end of a connection rather than by delays moving across the network.\nWeb pages reside on computer servers that can be overwhelmed when too many requests arrive at the same time. And many individuals access the Internet through relatively slow modem links.\nSuch delays could be eased by a proposal from Sun Microsystems to create a new Internet standard for the way computers access each others' files.\nCalled Web Network File System, the protocol reduces the burden on the computer holding the web pages, speeding the transfer of files and allowing three times as many Internet surfers to gain access at one time, according to Sanjay Sinha, head of Sun's Solaris Server project.\n\"In real life, most web servers are heavily loaded,\" Sinha said. Sun's web file system \"doesn't require that load.\"\nUser delays are real, but by some measures the Internet's performance has actually improved over the last few years.\nMatrix Information and Directory Services of Austin, Texas, compiles a weather report which it publishes on the Internet.\nThe report, updated every four hours, shows how long it takes a small message to travel from Matrix's headquarters to 4,500 major computers around the world and back.\nTraffic clogging the Internet slows the round trips. The reports show huge fluctuations in Internet traffic, with \"rush hour\" occuring weekdays as business users log on.\nBut the average delay declined by 30 percent between January 1994 and January 1996, according a report by Matrix.\n", "A broad coalition of corporations went to Capitol Hill on Tuesday to lobby in favor of relaxed export restrictions on computer encoding technology.\nOn Thursday, the Senate Commerce Committee will mark-up the Promotion of Commerce Online in the Digital Era Act of 1996 known as Pro-CODE, a bill that would abolish most export restrictions.\nUnder a Cold War-era munitions statute, only weak encryption programs created in the United States can be sold abroad, although domestic use of encryption is not regulated.\nCompanies in the high-tech industry argued they are losing business to foreign competitors who are not bound by U.S. export restrictions. And multinational companies in other industries said the the restrictions hamper their ability to conduct business overseas.\n\"We are at a competitive disadvantage vis-a-vis our foreign competitors and that is an unacceptable situation,\" Gregory Garcia, director of international trade affairs for the American Electronics Association, said at a press briefing here.\nThe Pro-Code bill, sponsored by Republican Senator Conrad Burns of Montana, Democratic Senator Pat Leahy of Vermont and others, has bipartisan support in the Commerce Committee.\n\"We support the Burns bill because it does enable companies to utilize encryption technology securely which is vital if we're going to compete in a very tough global marketplace,\" Victor Parra, president of the Electronic Messaging Association, said.\nThe association represents companies that rely on electronic communications, including Exxon Corp, Citicorp and Boeing Co, Parra said.\nEncryption programs use mathematical formulas to scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key.\"\nEarlier this week, Senator James Exon, the Nebraska Democrat, came out against the current bill in a letter to Commerce Committee chairman Sen Larry Pressler. Exon will likely offer amendments at the mark-up, an aide to the senator said.\nThe Clinton administration opposes the Pro-CODE bill, arguing that export of encryption technology would hamper law enforcement and intelligence gathering operatiobns.\nThe House Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on a similiar measure on September 25.\n--202-898-8312\n", "On the Internet, where new products come and go in the blink of an eye, time is said to move at \"Internet speed.\"\nBut in the rarefied air of Congress, where legislation often moves at a glacial pace, few would equate \"Washington time\" with the speed of cyberspace. That may be changing, however, as Congress struggles to come to grips with the Net as a phenomenon with great potential for reaching voters.\nIn the 1996 election, exit polls showed more than one-fourth of voters were \"wired\" and about 10 percent primarily used online sources of information in deciding how to vote. Responding to the surge in Net use by voters, congressional Internet use also has skyrocketed by some measures.\nAt the begining of 1994, just a handful of lawmakers had posted home pages on the World Wide Web. Two years later, 222 representatives and 85 senators had Web pages. The Congressional Internet Caucus has 91 members, up from 60 in the last Congress.\nDespite the flurry of activity, Congress will never be on the cutting edge, according to some who work in the capital.\n\"I expect Congress will always be one or many steps behind,\" Chris Casey, who helped set up the first congressional Web page for Sen. Edward Kennedy, told a briefing about the Web for congressional staff sponsored by the Internet caucus last week.\nA question about when Congress would be \"up to speed\" on the Net brought peals of laughter from the audience of staffers.\nBEYOND WEB PAGES\nNonetheless, some legislators have gone beyond posting simple Web pages and have integrated the Net into the most basic operations of their congressional offices. Rep. Anna Eshoo, a California Democrat whose district encompasses Silicon Valley, created a special area on her Web site to give constituents individualized information (http://www-eshoo.house.gov). A constituent sends Eshoo a query and receives a personal answer posted on a private part of the site accessible only to that individual with a password.\nSen. Pat Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, participates in live online chat sessions with school children in his home state with transcripts on his Web site (http://www.senate.gov/leahy). Leahy's office also is planning to start a newsgroup, a type of group mailing list on the Net, devoted to Vermont issues.\nAlmost all legislators accept electronic mail but most respond on paper through the mail. Leahy's office is one of the few that answer e-mail with e-mail, staffer Paul Mann said. Although some feared this might overwhelm the office with too many messages, \"surprisingly it hasn't happened,\" Mann said.\nFor the co-chairman of the Internet Caucus, Rep. Rick White, the Internet is a key foundation of his media strategy.\n\"The first place we send any press release is to our Web page,\" White staffer Aaron Weissman told the Web information session. Even media staff for the Washington state Republican Party look to the Web site (http://www.house.gov/white) to find copies of a release to send to the media, Weissman added.\nThe Internet is also changing the way groups lobby Congress. The Citizen's Internet Empowerment Coalition set up a Web page to get Internet users to send e-mail to Congress on the issue of restricting obscenity on the Net (http://www.ciec.org).\nBut since legislators are most interested in hearing from voters in their own districts, the page looks up the e-mail address of an Internet user and guides users to send targeted messages. \"We have a responsibility as advocates to educate Internet users,\" said Jonah Seiger of the Center for Democracy and Technology, which helped set up the coalition's site.\nMuch more remains to be done to educate users and legislators. While the text of bills is available online, some advocates want Congress to make more information available.\n\"There are broad sections of the electorate that are entirely uninformed about what our Congress does,\" Gary Ruskin, director of the Congressional Accountability Project, said. \"So much of the problem is that it is very, very difficult to obtain in real time the core documents of our democracy.\"\nRuskin urged that Congress post an assortment of documents on the Web, including voting records, disclosure forms, testimony from hearings and draft legislation.\n", "Legislators continued to debate on Wednesday one of the most difficult issues related to U.S. financial sector reform, but little common ground emerged.\nWhile most in Congress and industry now agree the Depression-era laws separating banking from other financial businesses should be eliminated, there is little consensus about going farther and allowing banks to combine with ordinary commercial firms.  \nHouse Banking Committee chairman Jim Leach, who has previously opposed mixing banking and commerce, reiterated his opposition at a hearing Wednesday.\n\"The more you keep financial services separate from commerce, the better,\" Leach said in testimony before the Banking Committee's Capital Markets Subcommittee.\nThe Iowa Republican has introduced a bill that would allow minimal combinations among banks and commercial firms. On the other side, Rep. Richard Baker, chairman of the subcommittee, has offered a bill that would impose virtually no limits on such combinations.  \nA possible middle approach, contained in a bill introduced by Rep. Marge Roukema, Republican of New Jersey, and Rep Bruce Vento, Democrat of Minnesota, would allow financial companies to conduct up to 25 percent of their business in non-financial activities.\nBaker, republican from Louisiana, continued to back his approach at the hearing.\n\"With limited regulatory oversight and greater vigor, financial institutions can pursue consumer demand and can broaden activities,\" he said. \"That should include commerce.\"  \nLeach did offer some new nuances to his previous statements on the issue. He provided the subcommittee with charts prepared by the Federal Reserve outlining the hypothetical mergers permitted under various approaches.\nFor example, a 25 percent limit on non-financial activity based on total asset size would allow a large bank like Chase Manhattan to acquire all but six of the largest companies in the entire country. If Chase merged with a large securities firm like Salomon Brothers, the Fed data indicated it could acquire even Exxon Corp, fourth largest company in the country based on market value.  \nA 10 percent limit would leave 18 companies out of Chase's sights or eight from a merged Chase-Salomon.\nBased on the Fed's findings, Leach suggested that, if Congress does include a percentage-based limitation, the limit should be a portion of total capital.\n\"If it seems that modest investment experimentation should be granted banks, a basket that relates to capital rather than business activity might, at least initially, be more prudential and less market distorting,\" he said.\nLooking at book equity values as a measure of capital, the Fed found Chase would be barred from acquiring the 74 largest companies in the United States under a 25 percent cap. Under a 10 percent cap, 215 large companies would be off-limits.

The delinquency rate was 1.42 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with 1.29 percent in the previous quarter and 1.41 percent in the same period the previous year.\nOn auto loans, the delinquency rate was 2.03 percent in the fourth quarter of 1996, compared with 1.95 percent the previous quarter and 1.87 percent a year earlier.\nDelinquent payments are defined as 30 days or more overdue.\n", "Congress revives the debate over encryption export policy this week but much has changed since last year's tussles.\nOnce the domain of spies and generals, encryption has become a critical component of electronic commerce and global communications on the Internet.\nThis year, the Clinton administration has a new policy in place allowing freer export of encryption products, programs that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key.\"\nThe new Clinton policy, enacted through executive order in November and in effect since January 1, allows export of stronger encryption than previously allowed.

Last year, most lawmakers seemed either in favor of relaxed export restrictions or undecided.\nThe full Senate Commerce Committee will hear testimony Wednesday on two bills introduced in the Senate to remove almost all export restrictions, and Thursday, the House Judiciary subcommittee on Courts and Intellectual Property will debate a similiar bill under consideration there.\nWhile the list of supporters of the bills has grown, some outspoken opponents have surfaced for the first time.\nSen Bob Kerrey made a statement on the Senate floor March 3 opposing the Senate bills.  \n\"The administration's policy not only can work, it is working,\" the Nebraska Democrat said. \"Congress should let the administration's negotiations and policies on encryption go forward, to succeed or fail on their own merits.\"\nAt confirmation hearings for Anthony Lake to head the Central Intelligence Agency last week, senators also raised the encryption issue and appeared to side with the administration, including Kerrey, Sen John Kyl, Republican of Arizona, and Sen John Kerry, Democrat of Massachusetts.\nLake Monday dropped out of the running for CIA chief.\nKyl plans to make a policy statement on the issue shortly, a staffer said, possibly as soon as Wednesday at a hearing on Internet crime in the Judiciary subcommittee Kyl chairs.\nSen Max Baucus was also said to be leaning towards the administration but a spokeswomen denied the Montana Democrat was inclined toward either side. Baucus is seeking a consensus approach and \"has taken no position on any of the proposed bills,\" spokeswoman Naomi Seligman said.\nSen Kerry's office did not return calls for comment.  \nAt the House encryption hearing, Under Secretary of Commerce William Reinsch, deputy director of the National Security Agency William Crowell and a member of the Department of Justice criminal division, will defend the Clinton policy.\nThe Senate will also hear from FBI director Louis Freeh and special encryption envoy David Aaron.\nIndustry representatives at the hearings will include officials from Netscape Communications Corp, one of the most vocal administration critics, and Microsoft Corp.\nPrivacy advocates will testify in the House, including Jerry Berman, executive director of the Center for Democracy and Technology, and Marc Rotenberg, director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center.\n((--202-898-8312))\n", "Congress revives the debate over encryption export policy this week but much has changed since last year's tussles.\nOnce the domain of spies and generals, encryption has become a critical component of electronic commerce and global communications on the Internet.\nThis year, the Clinton administration has a new policy in place allowing freer export of encryption products, which are programmes that scramble information and render it unreadable without a password or software \"key.\"\nThe new Clinton policy, enacted through executive order in November and in effect since January 1, allows export of stronger encryption than previously allowed.

For banks, confused computers could erroneously trigger a wave of bounced checks, missed loan payments and miscalculated interest rates.\nIn letters to Senate Banking Committee Chairman Alfonse D'Amato, regulators said they were aware of the dangers.  \nThe various agencies, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp and the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency, said they had formed an interagency working group to address the issue, often referred to as the \"Millennium Bug.\"\n\"The costs of making systems year 2000 compliant will be substantial and may affect some banks' earnings,\" Comptroller Eugene Ludwig, whose office oversees almost 3,000 national banks, wrote in a letter dated March 21. \"Most experts believe that even the most prepared organizations will encounter some problems.\"  \n\"The year 2000 rollover could pose substantial risks to the financial services industry,\" Nicholas Retsinas, director of the Office of Thrift Supervision, warned.\nAnalysts have said corporations and governments might have to spend $300 to $600 billion worldwide to correct the problem by rewriting software and reprogramming hardware.\nEven if banks correct all of their own computers, they could be brought down by computer errors from their major customers or third-party vendors, the regulators added.  \nBank examiners will question banks about year 2000 preparations this year, hopefully alerting them in time for solutions to be implemented and tested well before the end of 1999.\nSome programs may fail much sooner as they try to process current transactions such as mortgage loans that extend beyond the year 2000.\n\"This is not a project that can be delayed or the deadline extended,\" Federal Deposit Insurance Corp Director Nicholas Ketcha wrote in a recent memo to the agency's regional directors. \"Because of the nature of some date related calculations, many software programs currently running which are not year 2000 compliant may fail at some point prior to December 31, 1999.\"\nThe letters were in response to a query on the topic issued by Senator D'Amato earlier this month.
